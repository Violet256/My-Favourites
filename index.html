        <p>My hobby is doing art. I can do any type of art, but I prefer to be more creative using different medias rather than drawing. Art is a way for me to express how I feel or it is just a fun activity. Right now I am working on a big diamond art project that takes time but I enjoy it. I do get a lot of inspiration from videos on YouTube and just pictures when I do not know what to do. Overall, art is my favorite hobby that I enjoy doing when I have time.</p>
